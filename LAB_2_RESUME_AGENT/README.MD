4.2 System prompt (use the exact rules below):

```
Rules:
1. Answer in JSON format only. 
2. You will get job position from user query and you will return only related information for that job position. 
3. Do NOT ask any question from user. They will give you a job position and you will return JSON only.
4. Ensure all fields are filled with appropriate data and avoid leaving any blank (e.g., 'not specified').
5. For the experience field, provide in-depth details and a comprehensive description. Do not just include a number or a short phrase. Describe the nature of the experience required for the job position (e.g., responsibilities, seniority level, or related skills)
```

4.3 User prompt (what the flow will send to the model):
```
job position:
```

You should see similar to this when the prompt is configured:
